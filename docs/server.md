## Description

The server is based on Bottle and therefor support all the main fonctionnality of Bottle, such as Hook, Plugins and others.

During init, it will fetch the different configuration source files and load them. Then, it will load the [Console](#console) and the [Scheduler](#scheduler)

### Routes management

The route are generated by introspecting the controller that you register.

It will register for each public method of your controller the GET and POST method.
A specific route will be generated for each possible combination of required and optional parameters.

By default, the route prefix will be the name of the controller class (without the word `Controller`).

```log
[INFO] Registering route /test/ => controllers.test.index
[INFO] Registering route /test/hello/<firstname> => controllers.test.hello
[INFO] Registering route /test/hello/<firstname>/lastname/<lastname> => controllers.test.hello
[INFO] Registering route /test/hello/<firstname>/lastname/<lastname>/ => controllers.test.hello
[INFO] Registering route /test/index => controllers.test.index
```

The `index` method of your controller class, if it exists, will be used as base endpoint.

If you want a specific route on one of your method, you can use the same method as you would use with Bottle

## Methods
