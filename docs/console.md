## Description

The `Console` class is responsible for logging application activity, including errors and debug information. It provides a unified interface for outputting messages to the console and log files. Use this class to handle all logging, error, and debug output in your application.

The `Console` is used to log the application and also manage its own lifecycle (log rotation and compression).

It's binded to the application and therefore accessible to any controller.

## Methods

### log(text, log_type)

[[Source](https://github.com/MaJyxSoftware/qab_core/blob/main/qab_core/console.py#L44)]

The `log` method is the main method to use to log. It takes a first arguement as `text` and an optional argument as `log_type` (`"INFO"` by default).

Usage from your controller:

```python
class DemoController(Controller):
  ...

  def index(self):
    self.app.console.log("Hello from index of my controller")

    try:
      ...
    except:
      self.app.console.log("Error handled as expected", log_type="WARN")
```
